# Speed Dating Match Predictions Project

As technology develops, people are less and less likely to meet potential partners through organic means. Dating is approaching a new era where online dating applications are quickly rising in popularity. This project utilizes data from a speed dating experiment to examine trends in what people value when looking for partners through brief interactions. 

## Description 

I uttilized a dataset from a speed dating experiment conducted by Columbia Business School professors Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar. This experiment consisted of 21 separate events where participants met with individuals of the opposite sex for 4 minute long interactions. They were asked to fill out some demographic information, answer various personal questions, and rate their "dates" on following six attributes: 

1. Attractive
2. Sincere
3. Intelligent 
4. Fun
5. Ambitious
6. Shared Interests 

The use of exploratory data analysis revealed many interesting trends in how individuals viewed both themselves and potential partners. I also constructed four different types of machine learning models that predicted whether or not two individuals would match according to their responses and demographic data: 

1. Logistic Regression 
2. Decision Tree (Gini Index and Entropy) 
3. Random Forest Ensemble 
4. Support Vector Machine
